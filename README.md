Is this working
I think i'm doing this right
I'm assuming this is working
The commits count is going up. This is good. I think.
I think i'm going to like this class
The people here are cool
Did you know that today is my birthday?
Except i'm home alone all day
Which isn't too bad. I just get to do homework in peace and quiet
It's cold outside
I'm not really followimg instructions...
I just don't want to come back to my computer 30 different times during the day to update on the weather.
