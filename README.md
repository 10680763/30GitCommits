Did you know that today is my birthday?
Except i'm home alone all day
Which isn't too bad. I just get to do homework in peace and quiet
It's cold outside
I'm not really followimg instructions...
I just don't want to come back to my computer 30 different times during the day to update on the weather.
I hope I get a good grade on this assignment.
I am currently listening to music that's in spanish and I have no idea what is be being said.
Today is a good day.
I don't have too much homework so that's a plus.
This is easy.
